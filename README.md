This project aims at researching innovative methods for designing efficient method for parallel computation on Spartan 8 FPGA. The project implemented a fast multiplier(Modified Booth algorithm for partial product generation and carry look ahead adder for addition) for matrix multiplication. The matrices were transmitted from PC to FPGA using UART protocol.
